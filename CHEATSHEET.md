# Cheatsheet

This is a general cheatsheet for all the various plugins I have installed. This is on-going and I will try to add to this as I remember/discover stuff.

| Plugin   | Shortcut           | Descreption                                                                      |
| -------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| History  | `h`                | Prints your history                                                              |
| History  | `hs [searchterm]`  | searches your history with grep                                                  |
| History  | `hsi [serachterm]` | same as above but case insensitive.                                              |
| Copyfile | `copyfile [file]`  | Copy the contents of a file to your clipboard.                                   |
| Function | `weather`          | Returns the weather for the next few days                                        |
| Function | `last_modified`    | Returns the last modified file.                                                  |
| Function | `shell_colors`     | Prints out the list of the different colors used in Power10k conf.               |
| Function | `refresh`          | Refreshes the shell, I keep forgetting how to do this since I am using `ZDOTDIR` |
