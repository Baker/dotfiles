# TODO

This is an on going lists of things I want to add or enhance in this repo.

1. Automatically install iTerm for MacOS (Need to decide if that is OOS or not for this repo.)
2. Automatically set the color theme (Potential Solution: https://shyr.io/blog/sync-iterm2-configs from 2019, so not sure if still relevant.)
3. Automatically install the Menlo fonts used by Powerline/Oh-my-zsh
